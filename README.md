# MSA-analysis
Analysis code on the GEOS-Chem model output:

AQS, CARIBIC, ATom, HIPPO, SHADOZ, TCCON, ARCTAS codes show the re-production, model sampling, and model-obs comparison of AQS, CARIBIC, ATom, HIPPO, SHADOZ, TCCON, ARCTAS independent in-situ observations

CH2O/NO2 and CH2O are the model diagnostics on modeled low NOx chemistry and optimized model states

CO, NOx and ISOP emissions codes show the seasonal cycle and regional emission estimates for CO, NOx and ISOP

O3 and OH codes are used to analyze modeled abundances on lat-lon, lat-alt, and time series global mean statistics
